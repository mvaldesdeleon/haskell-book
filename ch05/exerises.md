# Type Matching

Below you’ll find a list of several standard functions we’ve talked about previously. Under that is a list of their type signatures. Match the function to its type signature. Try to do it without peeking at the type signatures (either in the text or in GHCi) and then check your work. You may find it easier to start from the types and work out what you think a function of that type would do.

1. Functions:

   a) `not`

   b) `length`

   c) `concat`

   d) `head`
   
   e) `(<)`
   
2. Type signatures:

   a) `_ :: [a] -> a`

   `head`

   b) `_ :: [[a]] -> [a]`

   `concat`

   c) `_ :: Bool -> Bool`

   `not`

   d) `_ :: [a] -> Int`

   `length`

   e) `_ :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool`

   `(<)`
